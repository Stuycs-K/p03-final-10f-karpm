How does the user interact with this program? (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
On connecting, the user is asked to input a username. Upon inputting their username, they are given access to the chat room. They can then freely type to send messages to all other users. If the user wishes to leave the chat, they can send "exit". If they also want to close the server when they leave, they can send "!exit".
The server operator can view all messages, with usernames and messages, on their terminal for moderation purposes.
Messages by other users are formatted as username (in blue): message (in yellow), while their own messages are in white and without their username.
